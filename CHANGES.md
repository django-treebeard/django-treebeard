* Change the `delete()` methods for all node classes to accept arbitrary positional and 
  keyword arguments which are passed to the parent method.
* Set `alters_data` and `queryset_only` attributes on the `delete()` methods for all node classes

This is a beta release.

* Added support for Django 1.5 and Python 3.X
* Updated docs: the library supports python 2.5+ and Django 1.4+. Dropped
  support for older versions
* Revamped admin interface for MP and NS trees, supporting drag&drop to reorder
  nodes. Work on this patch was sponsored by the
  `Oregon Center for Applied Science`_, inspired by `FeinCMS`_ developed by
  `Jesús del Carpio`_ with tests from `Fernando Gutierrez`_. Thanks ORCAS!
* Updated setup.py to use distribute/setuptools instead of distutils
* Now using pytest for testing

  implies, it returns the database vendor instead of the engine used. Treebeard
  will get the value from Django, but you can subclass the method if needed.

* The correct ordering in NS/MP trees is now enforced in the queryset.
* Cleaned up code, removed some unnecessary statements.
* Tests refactoring, to make it easier to spot the model being tested.
* Fixed support of trees using proxied models. It was broken due to a bug in
  Django.
* Fixed a bug in add_child when adding nodes to a non-leaf in sorted MP.
* There are now 648 unit tests. Test coverage is 96%
* This will be the last version compatible with Django 1.0. There will be a
  a 1.6.X branch maintained for urgent bug fixes, but the main development will
  focus on recent Django versions.
