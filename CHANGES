Release 1.60 (Apr 18, 2010)
---------------------------

* Added get_annotated_list, contributed by Alexey Kinyov
* Complete revamp of the documentation. It's now divided in sections for easier
  reading, and the package includes .rst files instead of the html build.
* Added raw id fields support in the admin
* Fixed setup.py to make it work in 2.4 again
* The correct ordering in NS/MP trees is now enforced in the queryset.
* Cleaned up code, removed some unnecessary statements.
* Tests refactoring, to make it easier to spot the model being tested.
* Fixed support of trees using proxied models. It was broken due to a bug in
  Django.
* Fixed a bug in add_child when adding nodes to a non-leaf in sorted MP.
* There are now 648 unit tests. Test coverage is 96%
* This will be the last version compatible with Django 1.0. There will be a
  a 1.6.X branch maintained for urgent bug fixes, but the main development will
  focus on recent Django versions.
