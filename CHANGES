This is a beta release.

* Added support for Django 1.5 and Python 3.X
* Updated docs: the library supports python 2.5+ and Django 1.4+. Dropped
  support for older versions
* Revamped admin interface for MP and NS trees, supporting drag&drop to reorder
  nodes. Work on this patch was sponsored by the
  `Oregon Center for Applied Science`_, inspired by `FeinCMS`_ developed by
  `Jesús del Carpio`_ with tests from `Fernando Gutierrez`_. Thanks ORCAS!
* Updated setup.py to use distribute/setuptools instead of distutils
* Now using pytest for testing

* The correct ordering in NS/MP trees is now enforced in the queryset.
* Cleaned up code, removed some unnecessary statements.
* Tests refactoring, to make it easier to spot the model being tested.
* Fixed support of trees using proxied models. It was broken due to a bug in
  Django.
* Fixed a bug in add_child when adding nodes to a non-leaf in sorted MP.
* There are now 648 unit tests. Test coverage is 96%
* This will be the last version compatible with Django 1.0. There will be a
  a 1.6.X branch maintained for urgent bug fixes, but the main development will
  focus on recent Django versions.
